          Hope’s first date with Brennan was a relaxed afternoon of fishing; something she still remembers fondly. 
          Somehow, she was able to catch a fish using just her hands and fishing line! She enjoys quiet outdoor moments like this where she can unwind and connect with nature.

          Traveling has become one of Hope's greatest passions. She finds freedom and inspiration in new places, especially in the mountains and nature-rich destinations.
          She's been to Banff, AB Canada (pictured), Sarasota, FL, and plans to visit many more places!
